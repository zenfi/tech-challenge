# Tech challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining Zenfi! For this challenge, you will create an open-source library.

1. The objective is to build a library that validates Mexican [RFCs](https://www.fonoa.com/blog/new-mandatory-rfc-validation-method-in-mexico) (Tax IDs).
2. You can use the code language of your preference.
3. Everything from code to documentation must be in English.
4. It can include anything you think a public library needs (tests, documentation...)

## What we'll evaluate

In no partciular order:

* Code efficiency: It's fast.
* Code cleanness/legibility: A regular human can easily understand how it works.
* Code maintenance: Any dev could add more features without breaking it.
* Functionality: What the library does and returns.

Enjoy!
